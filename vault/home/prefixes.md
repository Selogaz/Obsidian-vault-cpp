The headings and format of the prefix assignment are hard-coded. Prefixes are set and read from this file.
___

Prefixes can be used when creating notes by enclosing them in brackets:
`[[js console.log()]]`

Prefixes can be used when refactoring notes.
```
js consle.log()
The method writes (logs) a message to the console.
```
If you highlight the text above and then press `alt+f`, a note will be created where
- `js consle.log()` is the title of the note
- `The method writes (logs) a message to the console.` is the content

___

On the left is the name, on the right are the prefixes (separator `|`).
