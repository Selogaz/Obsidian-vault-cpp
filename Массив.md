An array in C++ is a collection of elements of the same type stored at contiguous memory locations. Each element in an array can be accessed directly by its index number. The index of the first element is zero, the second element is one, and so on.

Here is an example of how to declare and initialize an array in C++:

`int numbers[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};`

In this example, `numbers` is an array of integers. It contains five elements. The size of the array is determined automatically by the compiler based on the number of elements provided during initialization.

You can also specify the size of the array explicitly like this:

`int numbers[5];`

In this case, you have declared an array named `numbers` that can hold 5 integers. However, you haven't initialized any values yet.

Arrays are very useful in C++ for storing multiple values in a single variable. They are commonly used in loops, functions, and algorithms
