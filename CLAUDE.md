# Obsidian Vault

Personal knowledge management vault. Uses Obsidian-flavored Markdown with YAML frontmatter and a hierarchical knowledge architecture (Category → Meta-note → Problem → Hierarchy).

## CRITICAL: Skill-First Rule

**BLOCKING REQUIREMENT:** This vault operates entirely through skills. Before responding to ANY vault-related request — creating notes, managing tasks, tracking sources, building diagrams, explaining structure, or anything else — you MUST invoke the matching skill first using the Skill tool.

**NEVER:**
- Create or edit vault files without invoking a skill
- Generate frontmatter, wikilinks, or note content manually
- Answer "how to create X in this vault" — instead, CREATE it via the skill

**The Skill tool MUST be your first action. Generate no vault content before invoking the skill.**

## Restricted Directories — DO NOT MODIFY
